# PhaserCMD
Repository for CMD classes Programming for Real Time

In this repository you will find some examples of using Phaser 2.x

Although it may be used in class, it is a project maintained by me but paid for by no one. Requests for anything may therefor be denied based on time ...

If you want to post a request or find a bug, please use the Issues feature to notify me.
